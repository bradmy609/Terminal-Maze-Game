# Terminal-Maze-Game

This is a simple maze game that I created while learning javascript. When you run the script file, a field is randomly generated using a nested array of string characters. The field can be navigated by inputting urdl keys. The user wins when the indicator reaches the ^ symbol, and loses when the indicator falls off the map, or reaches an O symbol. 

Update: Added a maze solver function that first determines that the randomly generated maze is in fact solvable before allowing the user to attempt to solve it. If the maze is not solvable, the program will automatically regenerate the maze.
