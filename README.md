# Terminal-Maze-Game

This is a simple maze game that I created while learning javascript syntax and logic. When you run the script file, a field is randomly generated using a nested array of string characters. The field can be navigated with udrl string inputs. The user wins when the indicator reaches the ^ symbol, and loses when the indicator falls off the map, or reaches an O symbol.
